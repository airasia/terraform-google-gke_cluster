  The `_time_utc` values are allowed in 24-hour `HH:MM` format only and must be in UTC timezone.
  The `days_of_week` value is a CSV string containing 2-letter notations of days in a week in capital letters.
  Check the default values for reference. Note that, the timezone conversions from UTC do not impact the day values.
  
  KNOWN ISSUE: 
  If the `start_time_utc` is as late in the day as pushing `end_time_utc` over to the NEXT day in UTC, 
  then `end_time_utc` will become smaller than `start_time_utc` - this is disallowed by Terraform. 
  Therefore, both `start_time_utc` and `end_time_utc` must be within the same single day in UTC.

  node_pool_name: An arbitrary name to identify the GKE node pool and its VMs & VM instance groups.

  auto-down-scaling occurs.
  
  node_count_max_per_zone: The maximum number of nodes (per zone) this nodepool will allocate if
  auto-up-scaling occurs.
  
  node_labels: Kubernetes labels (key-value pairs) to be applied to each node. The kubernetes.io/
  and k8s.io/ prefixes are reserved by Kubernetes Core components and cannot be specified.
  See https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/container_cluster#labels.

  node_taints: Kubernetes taint to be applied to each node of the nodepool. Supported values for
  `effect` are `NO_SCHEDULE`, `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE` or `NO_EXECUTE`.
  See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/
  
  max_pods_per_node: The maximum number of pods per node in this node pool. This value has direct
  correlation with the IP range sizes availble in "var.pods_ip_range_name".
  See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr#cidr_ranges_for_clusters.
  
  machine_type: The size of VM for each node.
  See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types.
  
  disk_type: Type of the disk for each node. Acceptable values are "pd-standard", "pd-balanced" or
  "pd-ssd". "pd-standard" is default. "pd-ssd" is costly.
  
  disk_size_gb: Size of the disk on each node in Giga Bytes.
  
  preemptible: Preemptible nodes last a maximum of 24 hours and helps reduce cost while providing no
  availability guarantee. It is like spot instances in AWS EC2. Recommended for non-production
  clusters to help save cost. Not recommended for production clusters to help maintain availability.
  
  max_surge: Max number of node(s) that can be over-provisioned while the GKE cluster is undergoing
  a version upgrade. Raising the number would allow more number of node(s) to be upgraded
  simultaneously.
  
  max_unavailable: Max number of node(s) that can be allowed to be unavailable while the GKE
  cluster is undergoing a version upgrade. Raising the number would allow more number of node(s) to
  be upgraded simultaneously.
  
  enable_node_integrity: Whether to enable/disable the Secure Boot & Integrity Monitoring features

  See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/shielded-gke-nodes#node_integrity
